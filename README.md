##FRESHPLAYER-INSTALLER


Freshplayer-installer is a simple C script that manages the download, compiling and install of I-Rinat's Freshplayerplugin from it's [Official GitHub repository](https://github.com/i-rinat/freshplayerplugin).

It has nothing special, this script it's just A HELL REALLY BASIC ALMOST BEGINNERS LEVEL, but finally do his thing.

This was done because of the laziness of cloning/download & unzip and compile the project every time to install and/or upgrade, performing a script to do everything for me in one call. This liked to a friend of mine who test it, and he suggested me that upload it somewhere, because he found it very good, and voilÃ¡.


###USAGE:

It's as simple as typing:

>$ freshplayer install

it no needs ROOT privileges, and it installs the freshplayerplugin to the current user that do the calls.

>$ freshplayer uninstall

obviously uninstalls the freshplayer on the current user.

If, for several reasons, you want to install any other different commit than the latest update of the master branch of the freshplayer, you can do it by typing:

>$ freshplayer --commit [commit identifier]

or 

>$ freshplayer -c [commit identifier]

in that way, the freshplayer-installer will seek in the commit tree for the version that u asked, and when find it do his thing.

if you want to know more about how to get the commit identifier, [please read here](https://github.com/MALLER-LAGOON/Freshplayer-installer/blob/master/doc/commit.md).

###INSTALLING FRESHPLAYER-INSTALLER:


It's as simple as typing:

>$ sudo make all

And the make will compile and install the Freshplayer-installer

###DEPENDENCIES:

Sinces it's just a simple Ansi C script, it has no especial compiling needs, but to work it needs wget and unzip installed, which usually are installed by default, and it has obviously needs the same dependencies that freshplayerplugin to compile the freshplayerplugin, because magic doesn't really exist (yeah, face that truth!!!):

> $ sudo apt-get install wget unzip cmake pkg-config ragel libasound2-dev libssl-dev libglib2.0-dev libconfig-dev libpango1.0-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libevent-dev libgtk+2.0-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libxrandr-dev g++ libpulse-dev libxrender-dev

On Debian the package <code>libgtk+2.0-dev</code> is called <code>libgtk2.0-dev</code>, but usually the apt-get performs the package approval by it self.

<code>THIS IS JUST TO HELP YOU TO MANAGE THE DOWNLOAD, COMPILATION AND INSTALL THE LATEST FRESHPLAYER AVAILABLE ON I-RINAT'S GITHUB TO YOUR SYSTEM, FRESHPLAYER-INSTALLER IS NOT AN UPDATE SEEKER.</code>

###THANKS TO:

I-Rinat, your freshplayerplugin is a bless, i'm just one of a thousands fans of your creation. And like i said before: 
# YOU ARE THE BEST!!!
